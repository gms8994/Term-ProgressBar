A really simple progress bar for things that take a while.

Doing stuff: ###########

The bar grows as more stuff is done.  Fifty hash marks are printed
altogether.

use Term::ProgressBar;
my $num_items = 100;
my $bar = new Term::Progressbar('working magic', $num_items);
foreach (0 .. $num_items-1) {
    # do work for item $_
    update $bar;
}

This is free software and you may distribute it under the same terms
as perl itself.  There is no warranty.
